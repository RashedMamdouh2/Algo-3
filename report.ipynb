    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This report details the implementation of a wavefront planner algorithm for finding optimal trajectories in a 2D environment with obstacles. The algorithm was implemented in Python following the specified requirements for 8-point connectivity and optimal path generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Algorithm Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation consists of two main functions:\n",
    "1. `planner(map_data, start_row, start_column)`: Implements the wavefront algorithm and path generation\n",
    "2. `visualize_path(map_data, trajectory)`: Provides visualization capabilities for the environment and planned path\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The wavefront planner is implemented following these key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**\n",
    "   - Convert input map to numpy array\n",
    "   - Create value map initialized with infinity\n",
    "   - Set obstacles to 1\n",
    "   - Locate goal position (marked as 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Wave Propagation**\n",
    "   - Start from goal cell (value 2)\n",
    "   - Iteratively assign increasing values to neighboring cells\n",
    "   - Use prioritized 8-point connectivity:\n",
    "     - Primary directions: up, right, down, left\n",
    "     - Secondary directions: upper-right, lower-right, lower-left, upper-left\n",
    "   - Continue until all reachable cells are assigned values\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Path Generation**\n",
    "   - Start from initial position\n",
    "   - Iteratively move to neighboring cell with minimum value\n",
    "   - Continue until goal is reached\n",
    "   - Store path coordinates in trajectory list\n",

    "3. **Path Generation Phase**: O(p)\n",
    "   - Where p is the path length\n",
    "   - p ≤ n, so this phase is bounded by O(n)\n",
